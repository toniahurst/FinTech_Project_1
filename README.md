# FinTech_Project_1

Executive Summary/Overview

Though you will divide the work among your group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the application. Don’t silo yourself, hoping that everything will work together. Instead, check in regularly and offer support. Make sure you are in sync and help each other when a blocker arises.

of researching and choosing a portfolio of assets.

In this example, we built a database and analyzed performance. Finally, we deployed out notebook to a web app useing Voila.
